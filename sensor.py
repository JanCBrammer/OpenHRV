    Notes
    -----
    unexpected disconnection:
    - sensor lost skin contact
    - sensor out of range

    user disconnection:
    - user clicks disconnection button

    `await x` means "do `x` and wait for it to return". In the meantime,
    if `x` chooses to suspend execution, other tasks which have already
    started elsewhere may run. Also see [1] and [2].
